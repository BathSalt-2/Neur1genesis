# Neur1Genesis: Mixture of Autonomous Experts (MoAE) Core Intelligence Engine

## 1. Introduction

Neur1Genesis is envisioned as a futuristic Mixture of Autonomous Experts (MoAE) core intelligence engine. This document outlines its architectural design, focusing on the interplay of its key components: EchoNodes, the Daedalus Coordinator, Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data System (PPSDS), Neuro Adaptive Learning (ANAL), and the InfiniGen engine. The system aims to achieve self-aware, regenerative cognition through ethical, scalable, and contextually intelligent autonomous evolution.

## 2. Mixture of Autonomous Experts (MoAE) Architecture

At the heart of Neur1Genesis is the MoAE architecture, an evolution of the traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm. While conventional MoE models utilize a gating network to select specialized sub-networks (experts) for processing inputs, MoAE introduces the concept of 'autonomous experts' or 'EchoNodes'. These EchoNodes are not merely passive sub-networks but are fully autonomous entities capable of independent operation, contextual empathy, and self-evolution.

### 2.1. EchoNodes: The Autonomous Experts
