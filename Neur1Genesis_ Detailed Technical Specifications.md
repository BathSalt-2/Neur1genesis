This document provides detailed technical specifications for the Neur1Genesis project, building upon the architectural design outlined previously. It covers the technologies, data models, API specifications, and implementation details for each core component.

## 2. Core Technologies and Frameworks

To implement Neur1Genesis, we will leverage a combination of modern, scalable, and robust technologies:

*   **Backend Services:** Python with FastAPI for high-performance asynchronous APIs.

*   **Metaprogramming:** Python's `ast` module and custom code generation libraries for InfiniGen.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Homomorphic encryption libraries (e.g., TenSEAL) and differential privacy libraries (e.g., OpenDP) for PPSDS.

## 3. EchoNode Technical Specifications

### 3.1. EchoNode Data Model

Each EchoNode will maintain an internal state represented by a JSON document, stored in PostgreSQL for persistence. Key fields include:

```json

  "beliefs": {
    "environmental_data": {},
    "knowledge_graph_snapshot": {},
    "other_facts": {}
  },
  "desires": [
    {
      "goal_id": "uuid",

### 3.2. EchoNode APIs (Internal)

EchoNodes will expose internal gRPC APIs for direct communication with the Daedalus Coordinator and other EchoNodes for specific, synchronous interactions.

*   **`EchoNodeService.ReceiveTask(TaskRequest)`:** Allows Daedalus Coordinator to assign a task.
*   **`EchoNodeService.GetStatus(StatusRequest)`:** Returns the current status and load of the EchoNode.
*   **`EchoNodeService.UpdateBeliefs(BeliefUpdate)`:** Allows other EchoNodes or the Coordinator to push belief updates.
*   **`EchoNodeService.ProposeSolution(SolutionProposal)`:** Used for consensus-driven task allocation.

## 4. Daedalus Coordinator Technical Specifications

### 4.1. Daedalus Coordinator Data Model

The Coordinator will manage a registry of active EchoNodes, a global task queue, and meta-learning parameters. Stored in PostgreSQL.

```json
{
  "coordinator_id": "uuid",
  "active_echonodes": [
    {
      "echo_node_id": "uuid",
      "last_heartbeat": "timestamp",
      "current_load": "float"
    }
  ],
  "global_task_queue": [
    {
      "task_id": "uuid",
      "goal_id": "uuid",
      "description": "string",
      "status": "enum (pending, assigned, completed, failed)",
      "assigned_to": "uuid (EchoNode ID)",
      "priority": "int",
      "created_at": "timestamp"
    }
  ],
  "meta_learning_config": {}
}
```

### 4.2. Daedalus Coordinator APIs (External and Internal)

*   **External (REST/GraphQL for user interaction):**
    *   `POST /goals`: Submit a new natural language goal.
    *   `GET /status`: Get overall system status.
    *   `GET /tasks/{task_id}`: Get status of a specific task.
*   **Internal (gRPC for EchoNode interaction):**
    *   `CoordinatorService.AssignTask(TaskAssignment)`: Assigns a task to an EchoNode.
    *   `CoordinatorService.RequestSolutionProposal(ProposalRequest)`: Requests proposals from EchoNodes.
    *   `CoordinatorService.ReportTaskCompletion(TaskReport)`: Receives task completion reports.
    *   `CoordinatorService.UpdateMetaLearning(MetaLearningUpdate)`: Updates meta-learning parameters.

## 5. Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data System (PPSDS) Technical Specifications

### 5.1. PPSDS Data Flow

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Real-world sensitive data is ingested into PPSDS via a secure API endpoint.
2.  **Anonymization & Transformation:** Data undergoes differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., adding noise, k-anonymity) and is transformed into a suitable format for synthesis.
3.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) trained on the anonymized data produce synthetic datasets.
4.  **Synthetic Data Distribution:** EchoNodes or other authorized components can request synthetic data via a secure API.

### 5.2. PPSDS APIs

## 6. Neuro Adaptive Learning (ANAL) Technical Specifications

ANAL will be implemented as a set of modules within each EchoNode, leveraging existing machine learning libraries.

*   **Version Control:** Integration with an internal Git-like system for tracking code changes and enabling rollbacks.

## 8. Cross-Domain Intelligence Layer Technical Specifications

This layer will primarily be a set of microservices interacting with the Daedalus Coordinator and EchoNodes.

*   **Concept Fusion:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) operating on the Neo4j knowledge graph to identify analogies and fuse concepts.
*   **Intention Cascading:** A dedicated service that translates high-level intentions into granular directives for EchoNodes, using a hierarchical planning approach.

## 9. Frontend Technical Specifications

This document provides a comprehensive technical foundation for the implementation of Neur1Genesis. The next phase will involve the detailed design of agent schemas, communication protocols, adaptive learning loops, and metaprogramming scaffolds, followed by the actual implementation of these components.
